# Rebranding

## Why was the App rebranded?

### Clarity
The main reason for the change was to provide clarity.
Zap Android was just one implementation of the Zap family, which consists of Zap Android, Zap iOS and Zap Desktop.
All three implementations are based on their own code base and are each developed and maintained by different developers. The features that the implementations offer are also not identical. Some are present in one, but not in the others.
However, because all three implementations are known as Zap, users confuse information about one implementation with others.
This also affects the perceived status of development. Currently, Zap iOS and Zap Desktop are no longer being maintained, while Zap Android is still being developed.

With the rebranding to BitBanana, I hope to bring clarity.

### Team
While I enjoyed working with the Zap team arround Jack Mallers, they are by now fully focusing on Strike. But since I want to continue what I started with Zap Android, it's time to do it under my own name. They no longer take an active part in decisions and therefore should not be associated with the outcome.

## What changed?

Really not much. The whole git history is retained and the same developer is maintaining it. The fork happened at tag v0.5.9-beta.
Here are the changes:

- The Name
- The Logo
- Slight color adjustments
- Community management. BitBanana now has its own [discord][discord] channel.
- Over time more differences will occur as BitBanana is actively maintained and will receive new features.

Thanks for your interest! Now that you are familiar with the changes, have fun and
